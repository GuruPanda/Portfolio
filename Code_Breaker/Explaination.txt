These codes were created to test the efficiency of error  detection in Java and Python. The xChar, xLine and xVar python files get two random characters, two random lines and two random Variables from a code file and swap them. Each of the code files were then tested and a report was summated based on what percentage of errors were run time or compile. The xVar.py file is the most interesting as it implements an Abstract Syntax Tree and finds the variables as nodes.
