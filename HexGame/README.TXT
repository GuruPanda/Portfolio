This project creates a very basic HexGame that creates two players and a board using the GameManager, 
and makes calls to other classes. Of particular interest is the Breadth First Search and other methods 
in the Board class. 
This checks whether there is a path from one side of the board to the other, and therefore if someone 
has won the game.
